## Perks

### Template

- **Current** Points you can invest in this perk
- **Total** Total points available along this path
- **Needed** Points you need to invest in previous rows (all 3 paths count) to be able to unlock this row

|Points Current/Total/Needed|Description|
|:---:|---|
|5/5/0|Weapon Speciality (Damage)|
|5/10/4|Weapon Speciality (Utility)|
|1/11/8|Weapon Speciality (Unique)|
|5/16/12|All-Weapon Buff|
|5/21/16|Weapon Speciality (Utility)|
|3/24/20|Unique (Ultimate)|

### Numerical

Payback increases with every points invested in a perk, the reason is to create a dilemma that separate your points to unlock powerful perks earlier, or max out every perk you want to get full benefit from them. This could have some strategic factor involved in player growth.

All spec stacks additively to prevent too OP builds.

#### Builds.T

**Hit and Run** Running towards every body and hit them with a fully charged [Shotgun II] [Pistol IV] shotgun shot in the face. Momentum is power, Speed is pursue.

**Shimada Genji** Greatly cooldown reduction applied to Blink, melee attacks almost refresh it, even more it has a charge of 2. Never stop blinking and become the ghost in the battlefield.

**Chicago Alchemist** SMGs are great triggering elemental effects. Having SMGs with all kinds of element in weapon wheel, handle all kinds of situation would be so easy.

**Giant Slayer** Although [SMG VI] is nerfed against bosses, execution [SMG II] and guaranteed base damage could still be a good choice to cut down these powerful opponents.
